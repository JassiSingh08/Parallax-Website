        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Website</h2>
        <p>Parallax effects involve a website’s background moving at a different speed than the foreground content. This visual technique creates an illusion of depth which leads to a faux-3D effect upon scroll. 

            While parallax effects can make websites feel more interactive and engaging, it’s important to note that excessive movement within parallax effects can cause harm for those with vestibular disorders. The illusion of movement and depth can cause dizziness or disorientation. 
            
            If you use these websites as inspiration for your own, follow these guidelines for accessible parallax effect design:
            
            Keep the number of parallax effects to a minimum
            Constrain movement effects within a small area of the screen
            Include options for users to turn off parallax effects
            Don't let your effects distract users from important information.</p>
